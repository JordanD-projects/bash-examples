# Exclusion Set Smoke Test
- This script is designed to help autoomate the tedious process of testing Exception Sets in Jamf Protect. It requires the executing computer to be running both Protect and be enrolled in Jamf Pro. 

- If you want to use it, you simply run it like any other bash script and it will execute step by step, pausing to wait for input in order to progress. The only key accepted as input to move forward is the "Enter" key. Any other key will not move the script on to the next step.
